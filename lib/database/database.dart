        '''Google has enacted new death benefits for its employees, reports Forbes.
If an employee dies, that employee's spouse receives half the employee's salary for ten years.
There's no tenure requirement on this benefit either. Every one of Google's 34,000 employees is immediately eligible regardless of how long they've worked there.
On top of the half-salary, the spouse will also receive stock benefits, and children will receive \?1,000 per month until they turn 19.
One interesting question that's not clear from the reports: Does the policy cover same-sex spouses? A Google spokesman confirms with us that gay couples receive this same benefit, which makes this one of Google's many gay-friendly policies.

It makes the free lunch pale by comparison.''',

Without the moon, a day on earth would only last six to twelve hours. There could be more than a thousand days in one year! That's because the Earth's rotation slows down over time thanks to the gravitational force -- or pull of the moon -- and without it, days would go by in a blink.

Moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides -- making them about one-third as high as they are now.

Forget about seeing any lunar eclipses -- or any solar eclipses -- without the moon, there would be nothing to block the sun.

Without a moon, the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon, the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.''',

What if we charted the history of earth on a clock? When and where did humankind come into existence during the creation of life? Strange questions, right?
The team at One Clock experimented with this by condensing all the information about the history of the earth into a 24-hour time period. The findings were very interesting!
Humans have existed only for 77 seconds!
If midnight marks the formation of Earth on the clock, dinosaurs, mammals, and humans would be last in the line of creation.
In fact, human history doesn't begin until 11:58:43 p.m!
It's interesting to notice that even the simplest forms of life didn't exist until 4 a.m.
Dinosaurs lived and died in almost 30 minutes!
Doesn't it make one realize how truly vast the existence of the earth is and humans are just such a tiny part of it?

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

The ventral tegmental area is part of what is known as the brain's reward circuit, which, coincidentally, was discovered by Olds's father, James, when she was seven years old. This circuit is considered to be a primitive neural network, meaning it is evolutionarily old; it links with the nucleus accumbens. Some of the other structures that contribute to the reward circuit, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex, are exceptionally sensitive to (and reinforce of) behavior that induces pleasure, such as sex, food consumption, and drug use.''',

        "discription":
            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

The ventral tegmental area is part of what is known as the brain's reward circuit, which, coincidentally, was discovered by Olds's father, James, when she was seven years old. This circuit is considered to be a primitive neural network, meaning it is evolutionarily old; it links with the nucleus accumbens. Some of the other structures that contribute to the reward circuit, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex, are exceptionally sensitive to (and reinforce of) behavior that induces pleasure, such as sex, food consumption, and drug use.''',

            '''In 1930, laws were proposed in Massachusetts and St. Louis to ban radios while driving. According to automotive historian Michael Lamm, "Opponents of car radios argued that they distracted drivers and caused accidents, that tuning them took a driver's attention away from the road, and that music could lull a driver to sleep."

Even the Auto Club of New York agreed. In their 1934 poll, 56 percent deemed the car radio a "dangerous distraction" Arguing the other side was the Radio Manufacturers Association, who pointed out that car radios could be used to warn drivers of inclement weather and bad road conditions, as well as keeping them awake when they got drowsy.
A little history on the car radio: The first one was introduced in 1922 by Chevrolet. It cost a whopping 200. With an antenna that covered the car's entire roof, batteries that barely fit under the front seat and two mammoth speakers attached behind the seat, it was about as convenient as taking a live orchestra along for a ride.
By the early 1930s, the less cumbersome built-in Motorola radios were standard features in cars. Later in the decade, push-button tuning and presets helped drivers to select stations without taking their eyes off the road. By 1946, 9 million cars had radios. Thanks to the transistor, both size and price came way down so that by 1963, 50 million cars, over 60 percent, were outfitted with radios. Over one-third of America's radio listening occurred in the car.
And those anti-radio laws? Though a few were signed in small municipalities, they mostly went nowhere, unlike the current anti-texting laws.
Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have now banned texting while driving. And the tickets are already piling up. In New York last year, over 5,000 texting tickets were written (each carries a 150 fine plus two points).''',

            '''Stomp on the gas in a new Ford Mustang or F-150, and you'll hear a meaty, throaty rumble, the same style roar that Americans have associated with auto power and performance for decades.

In some of America's best-selling cars and trucks, the engine growl is a finely tuned bit of lip-syncing, boosted through special pipes or digitally faked altogether. And it's driving car enthusiasts insane.

Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away.

Softer-sounding engines are a positive symbol of just how far engines and the gas economy have progressed. But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.

"Enhanced" engine songs have become the signature of eerily quiet electrics like the Toyota Prius. But the fakery is now increasingly finding its way into even beefy trucks and muscle cars, long revered for their iconic growl.

For the 2015 Mustang EcoBoost, Ford sound engineers and developers worked on an "Active Noise Control" system that amplifies the engine's purr through the car speakers. Afterward, the automaker surveyed members of Mustang fan clubs on which processed "sound concepts" they most enjoyed.

Ford said in a statement the vintage V8 engine boom "has long been considered the mating call of Mustang" but added that the newly processed pony-car sound is "athletic and youthful," "a more refined growl" with "a low-frequency sense of powerfulness."

Without the moon, a day on earth would only last six to twelve hours. There could be more than a thousand days in one year! That's because the Earth's rotation slows down over time thanks to the gravitational force -- or pull of the moon -- and without it, days would go by in a blink.

Moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides -- making them about one-third as high as they are now.

Forget about seeing any lunar eclipses -- or any solar eclipses -- without the moon, there would be nothing to block the sun.

Without a moon, the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon, the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.''',

The team at One Clock experimented with this by condensing all the information about the history of the earth into a 24-hour time period. The findings were very interesting!
Humans have existed only for 77 seconds!
If midnight marks the formation of Earth on the clock, dinosaurs, mammals, and humans would be last in the line of creation.
In fact, human history doesn't begin until 11:58:43 p.m!
It's interesting to notice that even the simplest forms of life didn't exist until 4 a.m.
Dinosaurs lived and died in almost 30 minutes!

            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

The ventral tegmental area is part of what is known as the brain's reward circuit, which, coincidentally, was discovered by Olds's father, James, when she was seven years old. This circuit is considered to be a primitive neural network, meaning it is evolutionarily old; it links with the nucleus accumbens. Some of the other structures that contribute to the reward circuit, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex, are exceptionally sensitive to (and reinforce of) behavior that induces pleasure, such as sex, food consumption, and drug use.''',

            '''In 1930, laws were proposed in Massachusetts and St. Louis to ban radios while driving. According to automotive historian Michael Lamm, "Opponents of car radios argued that they distracted drivers and caused accidents, that tuning them took a driver's attention away from the road, and that music could lull a driver to sleep."

Even the Auto Club of New York agreed. In their 1934 poll, 56 percent deemed the car radio a "dangerous distraction" Arguing the other side was the Radio Manufacturers Association, who pointed out that car radios could be used to warn drivers of inclement weather and bad road conditions, as well as keeping them awake when they got drowsy.
A little history on the car radio: The first one was introduced in 1922 by Chevrolet. It cost a whopping 200. With an antenna that covered the car's entire roof, batteries that barely fit under the front seat and two mammoth speakers attached behind the seat, it was about as convenient as taking a live orchestra along for a ride.
By the early 1930s, the less cumbersome built-in Motorola radios were standard features in cars. Later in the decade, push-button tuning and presets helped drivers to select stations without taking their eyes off the road. By 1946, 9 million cars had radios. Thanks to the transistor, both size and price came way down so that by 1963, 50 million cars, over 60 percent, were outfitted with radios. Over one-third of America's radio listening occurred in the car.
And those anti-radio laws? Though a few were signed in small municipalities, they mostly went nowhere, unlike the current anti-texting laws.
Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have now banned texting while driving. And the tickets are already piling up. In New York last year, over 5,000 texting tickets were written (each carries a 150 fine plus two points).''',

            '''Stomp on the gas in a new Ford Mustang or F-150, and you'll hear a meaty, throaty rumble, the same style roar that Americans have associated with auto power and performance for decades.

In some of America's best-selling cars and trucks, the engine growl is a finely tuned bit of lip-syncing, boosted through special pipes or digitally faked altogether. And it's driving car enthusiasts insane.

Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away.

Softer-sounding engines are a positive symbol of just how far engines and the gas economy have progressed. But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.

"Enhanced" engine songs have become the signature of eerily quiet electrics like the Toyota Prius. But the fakery is now increasingly finding its way into even beefy trucks and muscle cars, long revered for their iconic growl.

For the 2015 Mustang EcoBoost, Ford sound engineers and developers worked on an "Active Noise Control" system that amplifies the engine's purr through the car speakers. Afterward, the automaker surveyed members of Mustang fan clubs on which processed "sound concepts" they most enjoyed.

Ford said in a statement the vintage V8 engine boom "has long been considered the mating call of Mustang" but added that the newly processed pony-car sound is "athletic and youthful," "a more refined growl" with "a low-frequency sense of powerfulness."

Without the moon, a day on earth would only last six to twelve hours. There could be more than a thousand days in one year! That's because the Earth's rotation slows down over time thanks to the gravitational force -- or pull of the moon -- and without it, days would go by in a blink.

Moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides -- making them about one-third as high as they are now.

Forget about seeing any lunar eclipses -- or any solar eclipses -- without the moon, there would be nothing to block the sun.

Without a moon, the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon, the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.''',

The team at One Clock experimented with this by condensing all the information about the history of the earth into a 24-hour time period. The findings were very interesting!
Humans have existed only for 77 seconds!
If midnight marks the formation of Earth on the clock, dinosaurs, mammals, and humans would be last in the line of creation.
In fact, human history doesn't begin until 11:58:43 p.m!
It's interesting to notice that even the simplest forms of life didn't exist until 4 a.m.
Dinosaurs lived and died in almost 30 minutes!

            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

The ventral tegmental area is part of what is known as the brain's reward circuit, which, coincidentally, was discovered by Olds's father, James, when she was seven years old. This circuit is considered to be a primitive neural network, meaning it is evolutionarily old; it links with the nucleus accumbens. Some of the other structures that contribute to the reward circuit, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex, are exceptionally sensitive to (and reinforce of) behavior that induces pleasure, such as sex, food consumption, and drug use.''',

            '''In 1930, laws were proposed in Massachusetts and St. Louis to ban radios while driving. According to automotive historian Michael Lamm, "Opponents of car radios argued that they distracted drivers and caused accidents, that tuning them took a driver's attention away from the road, and that music could lull a driver to sleep."

Even the Auto Club of New York agreed. In their 1934 poll, 56 percent deemed the car radio a "dangerous distraction" Arguing the other side was the Radio Manufacturers Association, who pointed out that car radios could be used to warn drivers of inclement weather and bad road conditions, as well as keeping them awake when they got drowsy.
A little history on the car radio: The first one was introduced in 1922 by Chevrolet. It cost a whopping 200. With an antenna that covered the car's entire roof, batteries that barely fit under the front seat and two mammoth speakers attached behind the seat, it was about as convenient as taking a live orchestra along for a ride.
By the early 1930s, the less cumbersome built-in Motorola radios were standard features in cars. Later in the decade, push-button tuning and presets helped drivers to select stations without taking their eyes off the road. By 1946, 9 million cars had radios. Thanks to the transistor, both size and price came way down so that by 1963, 50 million cars, over 60 percent, were outfitted with radios. Over one-third of America's radio listening occurred in the car.
And those anti-radio laws? Though a few were signed in small municipalities, they mostly went nowhere, unlike the current anti-texting laws.
Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have now banned texting while driving. And the tickets are already piling up. In New York last year, over 5,000 texting tickets were written (each carries a 150 fine plus two points).''',

            '''Stomp on the gas in a new Ford Mustang or F-150, and you'll hear a meaty, throaty rumble, the same style roar that Americans have associated with auto power and performance for decades.

In some of America's best-selling cars and trucks, the engine growl is a finely tuned bit of lip-syncing, boosted through special pipes or digitally faked altogether. And it's driving car enthusiasts insane.

Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away.

Softer-sounding engines are a positive symbol of just how far engines and the gas economy have progressed. But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.

"Enhanced" engine songs have become the signature of eerily quiet electrics like the Toyota Prius. But the fakery is now increasingly finding its way into even beefy trucks and muscle cars, long revered for their iconic growl.

For the 2015 Mustang EcoBoost, Ford sound engineers and developers worked on an "Active Noise Control" system that amplifies the engine's purr through the car speakers. Afterward, the automaker surveyed members of Mustang fan clubs on which processed "sound concepts" they most enjoyed.

Ford said in a statement the vintage V8 engine boom "has long been considered the mating call of Mustang" but added that the newly processed pony-car sound is "athletic and youthful," "a more refined growl" with "a low-frequency sense of powerfulness."

Without the moon, a day on earth would only last six to twelve hours. There could be more than a thousand days in one year! That's because the Earth's rotation slows down over time thanks to the gravitational force -- or pull of the moon -- and without it, days would go by in a blink.

Moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides -- making them about one-third as high as they are now.

Forget about seeing any lunar eclipses -- or any solar eclipses -- without the moon, there would be nothing to block the sun.

Without a moon, the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon, the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.''',

The team at One Clock experimented with this by condensing all the information about the history of the earth into a 24-hour time period. The findings were very interesting!
Humans have existed only for 77 seconds!
If midnight marks the formation of Earth on the clock, dinosaurs, mammals, and humans would be last in the line of creation.
In fact, human history doesn't begin until 11:58:43 p.m!
It's interesting to notice that even the simplest forms of life didn't exist until 4 a.m.

            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

The ventral tegmental area is part of what is known as the brain's reward circuit, which, coincidentally, was discovered by Olds's father, James, when she was seven years old. This circuit is considered to be a primitive neural network, meaning it is evolutionarily old; it links with the nucleus accumbens. Some of the other structures that contribute to the reward circuit, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex, are exceptionally sensitive to (and reinforce of) behavior that induces pleasure, such as sex, food consumption, and drug use.''',

            '''In 1930, laws were proposed in Massachusetts and St. Louis to ban radios while driving. According to automotive historian Michael Lamm, "Opponents of car radios argued that they distracted drivers and caused accidents, that tuning them took a driver's attention away from the road, and that music could lull a driver to sleep."

Even the Auto Club of New York agreed. In their 1934 poll, 56 percent deemed the car radio a "dangerous distraction" Arguing the other side was the Radio Manufacturers Association, who pointed out that car radios could be used to warn drivers of inclement weather and bad road conditions, as well as keeping them awake when they got drowsy.
A little history on the car radio: The first one was introduced in 1922 by Chevrolet. It cost a whopping 200. With an antenna that covered the car's entire roof, batteries that barely fit under the front seat and two mammoth speakers attached behind the seat, it was about as convenient as taking a live orchestra along for a ride.
By the early 1930s, the less cumbersome built-in Motorola radios were standard features in cars. Later in the decade, push-button tuning and presets helped drivers to select stations without taking their eyes off the road. By 1946, 9 million cars had radios. Thanks to the transistor, both size and price came way down so that by 1963, 50 million cars, over 60 percent, were outfitted with radios. Over one-third of America's radio listening occurred in the car.
And those anti-radio laws? Though a few were signed in small municipalities, they mostly went nowhere, unlike the current anti-texting laws.
Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have now banned texting while driving. And the tickets are already piling up. In New York last year, over 5,000 texting tickets were written (each carries a 150 fine plus two points).''',

            '''Stomp on the gas in a new Ford Mustang or F-150, and you'll hear a meaty, throaty rumble, the same style roar that Americans have associated with auto power and performance for decades.

In some of America's best-selling cars and trucks, the engine growl is a finely tuned bit of lip-syncing, boosted through special pipes or digitally faked altogether. And it's driving car enthusiasts insane.

Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away.

Softer-sounding engines are a positive symbol of just how far engines and the gas economy have progressed. But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.

"Enhanced" engine songs have become the signature of eerily quiet electrics like the Toyota Prius. But the fakery is now increasingly finding its way into even beefy trucks and muscle cars, long revered for their iconic growl.

For the 2015 Mustang EcoBoost, Ford sound engineers and developers worked on an "Active Noise Control" system that amplifies the engine's purr through the car speakers. Afterward, the automaker surveyed members of Mustang fan clubs on which processed "sound concepts" they most enjoyed.

Ford said in a statement the vintage V8 engine boom "has long been considered the mating call of Mustang" but added that the newly processed pony-car sound is "athletic and youthful," "a more refined growl" with "a low-frequency sense of powerfulness."

Without the moon, a day on earth would only last six to twelve hours. There could be more than a thousand days in one year! That's because the Earth's rotation slows down over time thanks to the gravitational force -- or pull of the moon -- and without it, days would go by in a blink.

Moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides -- making them about one-third as high as they are now.

Forget about seeing any lunar eclipses -- or any solar eclipses -- without the moon, there would be nothing to block the sun.

Without a moon, the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon, the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.''',

The team at One Clock experimented with this by condensing all the information about the history of the earth into a 24-hour time period. The findings were very interesting!
Humans have existed only for 77 seconds!
If midnight marks the formation of Earth on the clock, dinosaurs, mammals, and humans would be last in the line of creation.
In fact, human history doesn't begin until 11:58:43 p.m!
It's interesting to notice that even the simplest forms of life didn't exist until 4 a.m.
Dinosaurs lived and died in almost 30 minutes!

            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

The ventral tegmental area is part of what is known as the brain's reward circuit, which, coincidentally, was discovered by Olds's father, James, when she was seven years old. This circuit is considered to be a primitive neural network, meaning it is evolutionarily old; it links with the nucleus accumbens.

            '''In 1930, laws were proposed in Massachusetts and St. Louis to ban radios while driving. According to automotive historian Michael Lamm, "Opponents of car radios argued that they distracted drivers and caused accidents, that tuning them took a driver's attention away from the road, and that music could lull a driver to sleep."

Even the Auto Club of New York agreed. In their 1934 poll, 56 percent deemed the car radio a "dangerous distraction" Arguing the other side was the Radio Manufacturers Association, who pointed out that car radios could be used to warn drivers of inclement weather and bad road conditions, as well as keeping them awake when they got drowsy.
A little history on the car radio: The first one was introduced in 1922 by Chevrolet. It cost a whopping 200. With an antenna that covered the car's entire roof, batteries that barely fit under the front seat and two mammoth speakers attached behind the seat, it was about as convenient as taking a live orchestra along for a ride.
By the early 1930s, the less cumbersome built-in Motorola radios were standard features in cars. Later in the decade, push-button tuning and presets helped drivers to select stations without taking their eyes off the road. By 1946, 9 million cars had radios. Thanks to the transistor, both size and price came way down so that by 1963, 50 million cars, over 60 percent, were outfitted with radios. Over one-third of America's radio listening occurred in the car.
And those anti-radio laws? Though a few were signed in small municipalities, they mostly went nowhere, unlike the current anti-texting laws.
Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have now banned texting while driving. And the tickets are already piling up. In New York last year, over 5,000 texting tickets were written (each carries a 150 fine plus two points).''',

            '''Stomp on the gas in a new Ford Mustang or F-150, and you'll hear a meaty, throaty rumble, the same style roar that Americans have associated with auto power and performance for decades.

In some of America's best-selling cars and trucks, the engine growl is a finely tuned bit of lip-syncing, boosted through special pipes or digitally faked altogether. And it's driving car enthusiasts insane.

Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away.

Softer-sounding engines are a positive symbol of just how far engines and the gas economy have progressed. But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.

"Enhanced" engine songs have become the signature of eerily quiet electrics like the Toyota Prius. But the fakery is now increasingly finding its way into even beefy trucks and muscle cars, long revered for their iconic growl.

For the 2015 Mustang EcoBoost, Ford sound engineers and developers worked on an "Active Noise Control" system that amplifies the engine's purr through the car speakers. Afterward, the automaker surveyed members of Mustang fan clubs on which processed "sound concepts" they most enjoyed.

Ford said in a statement the vintage V8 engine boom "has long been considered the mating call of Mustang" but added that the newly processed pony-car sound is "athletic and youthful," "a more refined growl" with "a low-frequency sense of powerfulness."

Moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides -- making them about one-third as high as they are now.

Forget about seeing any lunar eclipses -- or any solar eclipses -- without the moon, there would be nothing to block the sun.

Without a moon, the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon, the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.''',

The team at One Clock experimented with this by condensing all the information about the history of the earth into a 24-hour time period. The findings were very interesting!
Humans have existed only for 77 seconds!
If midnight marks the formation of Earth on the clock, dinosaurs, mammals, and humans would be last in the line of creation.

It's interesting to notice that even the simplest forms of life didn't exist until 4 a.m.

            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

            '''In 1930, laws were proposed in Massachusetts and St. Louis to ban radios while driving. According to automotive historian Michael Lamm, "Opponents of car radios argued that they distracted drivers and caused accidents, that tuning them took a driver's attention away from the road, and that music could lull a driver to sleep."

Even the Auto Club of New York agreed. In their 1934 poll, 56 percent deemed the car radio a "dangerous distraction" Arguing the other side was the Radio Manufacturers Association, who pointed out that car radios could be used to warn drivers of inclement weather and bad road conditions, as well as keeping them awake when they got drowsy.
A little history on the car radio: The first one was introduced in 1922 by Chevrolet. It cost a whopping 200. With an antenna that covered the car's entire roof, batteries that barely fit under the front seat and two mammoth speakers attached behind the seat, it was about as convenient as taking a live orchestra along for a ride.
By the early 1930s, the less cumbersome built-in Motorola radios were standard features in cars. Later in the decade, push-button tuning and presets helped drivers to select stations without taking their eyes off the road. By 1946, 9 million cars had radios. Thanks to the transistor, both size and price came way down so that by 1963, 50 million cars, over 60 percent, were outfitted with radios. Over one-third of America's radio listening occurred in the car.
And those anti-radio laws? Though a few were signed in small municipalities, they mostly went nowhere, unlike the current anti-texting laws.
Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have now banned texting while driving. And the tickets are already piling up. In New York last year, over 5,000 texting tickets were written (each carries a 150 fine plus two points).''',

            '''Stomp on the gas in a new Ford Mustang or F-150, and you'll hear a meaty, throaty rumble, the same style roar that Americans have associated with auto power and performance for decades.

In some of America's best-selling cars and trucks, the engine growl is a finely tuned bit of lip-syncing, boosted through special pipes or digitally faked altogether. And it's driving car enthusiasts insane.

Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away.

Softer-sounding engines are a positive symbol of just how far engines and the gas economy have progressed. But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.

"Enhanced" engine songs have become the signature of eerily quiet electrics like the Toyota Prius. But the fakery is now increasingly finding its way into even beefy trucks and muscle cars, long revered for their iconic growl.

For the 2015 Mustang EcoBoost, Ford sound engineers and developers worked on an "Active Noise Control" system that amplifies the engine's purr through the car speakers. Afterward, the automaker surveyed members of Mustang fan clubs on which processed "sound concepts" they most enjoyed.

Ford said in a statement the vintage V8 engine boom "has long been considered the mating call of Mustang" but added that the newly processed pony-car sound is "athletic and youthful," "a more refined growl" with "a low-frequency sense of powerfulness."

Moonless earth would also change the size of ocean tides -- making them about one-third as high as they are now.

Forget about seeing any lunar eclipses -- or any solar eclipses -- without the moon, there would be nothing to block the sun.

Without a moon, the tilt of our earth's axis would vary over time. This could create some very wild weather. Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon, the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.''',

The team at One Clock experimented with this by condensing all the information about the history of the earth into a 24-hour time period. The findings were very interesting!
Humans have existed only for 77 seconds!
If midnight marks the formation of Earth on the clock, dinosaurs, mammals, and humans would be last in the line of creation.
In fact, human history doesn't begin until 11:58:43 p.m!
It's interesting to notice that even the simplest forms of life didn't exist until 4 a.m.
Dinosaurs lived and died in almost 30 minutes!

            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',

The ventral tegmental area is part of what is known as the brain's reward circuit, which, coincidentally, was discovered by Olds's father, James, when she was seven years old. This circuit is considered to be a primitive neural network, meaning it is evolutionarily old; it links with the nucleus accumbens. Some of the other structures that contribute to the reward circuit, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex, are exceptionally sensitive to (and reinforce of) behavior that induces pleasure, such as sex, food consumption, and drug use.''',

            '''Richard Schwartz and Jacqueline Olds know a lot about love. These Harvard Medical School (HMS) professors and couples therapists study how love evolves and, too often, how it collapses. They have also been happily married for nearly four decades.

Love may well be one of the most studied but least understood behaviors. More than 20 years ago, the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studied 166 societies and found evidence of romantic love, the kind that leaves one breathless and euphoric in 147 of them. This ubiquity, said Schwartz, an HMS associate professor of psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., indicates that "there's good reason to suspect that romantic love is kept alive by something basic to our biological nature."

Rewarding ourselves with love

In 2005, Fisher led a research team that published a groundbreaking study that included the first functional MRI (fMRI) images of the brains of individuals in the throes of romantic love. Her team analyzed 2,500 brain scans of college students who viewed pictures of someone special to them and compared the scans to ones taken when the students looked at pictures of acquaintances. Photos of people they romantically loved caused the participants' brains to become active in regions rich with dopamine, the so-called feel-good neurotransmitter. Two of the brain regions that showed activity in the fMRI scans were the caudate nucleus, a region associated with reward detection and expectation and the integration of sensory experiences into social behavior, and the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with pleasure, focused attention, and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.

            '''In 1930, laws were proposed in Massachusetts and St. Louis to ban radios while driving. According to automotive historian Michael Lamm, "Opponents of car radios argued that they distracted drivers and caused accidents, that tuning them took a driver's attention away from the road, and that music could lull a driver to sleep."

Even the Auto Club of New York agreed. In their 1934 poll, 56 percent deemed the car radio a "dangerous distraction" Arguing the other side was the Radio Manufacturers Association, who pointed out that car radios could be used to warn drivers of inclement weather and bad road conditions, as well as keeping them awake when they got drowsy.
A little history on the car radio: The first one was introduced in 1922 by Chevrolet. It cost a whopping 200. With an antenna that covered the car's entire roof, batteries that barely fit under the front seat and two mammoth speakers attached behind the seat, it was about as convenient as taking a live orchestra along for a ride.
By the early 1930s, the less cumbersome built-in Motorola radios were standard features in cars. Later in the decade, push-button tuning and presets helped drivers to select stations without taking their eyes off the road. By 1946, 9 million cars had radios. Thanks to the transistor, both size and price came way down so that by 1963, 50 million cars, over 60 percent, were outfitted with radios. Over one-third of America's radio listening occurred in the car.
And those anti-radio laws? Though a few were signed in small municipalities, they mostly went nowhere, unlike the current anti-texting laws.
Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have now banned texting while driving. And the tickets are already piling up. In New York last year, over 5,000 texting tickets were written (each carries a 150 fine plus two points).''',

            '''Stomp on the gas in a new Ford Mustang or F-150, and you'll hear a meaty, throaty rumble, the same style roar that Americans have associated with auto power and performance for decades.

In some of America's best-selling cars and trucks, the engine growl is a finely tuned bit of lip-syncing, boosted through special pipes or digitally faked altogether. And it's driving car enthusiasts insane.

Fake engine noise has become one of the auto industry's dirty little secrets, with automakers from BMW to Volkswagen turning to a sound-boosting bag of tricks. Without them, today's more fuel-efficient engines would sound far quieter and, automakers worry, seemingly less powerful, potentially pushing buyers away.

Softer-sounding engines are a positive symbol of just how far engines and the gas economy have progressed. But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.

"Enhanced" engine songs have become the signature of eerily quiet electrics like the Toyota Prius. But the fakery is now increasingly finding its way into even beefy trucks and muscle cars, long revered for their iconic growl.

For the 2015 Mustang EcoBoost, Ford sound engineers and developers worked on an "Active Noise Control" system that amplifies the engine's purr through the car speakers. Afterward, the automaker surveyed members of Mustang fan clubs on which processed "sound concepts" they most enjoyed.

Ford said in a statement the vintage V8 engine boom "has long been considered the mating call of Mustang" but added that the newly processed pony-car sound is "athletic and youthful," "a more refined growl" with "a low-frequency sense of powerfulness."

            '''Infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste is mainly measured by the quantity the infant ingests, sucking patterns, and facial expression in response to ingestion of water solutions with different concentrations of salt. Because of the nature of these measurements, it is hard to distinguish between infantsâ€™ ability to detect sodium and infantsâ€™ preference for, or liking of, sodium.

Newborns have a biological need for sodium, which brings up the question of why newborns are not able to show a preferential response to salty taste as they show for sweet taste. The lack of a salt taste response might have an evolutionary reason. Although there is a need for sodium at birth, the first food the infant naturally encounters is breastmilk, which is dominated by the sweet taste and contains a sufficient concentration of sodium for the baby to thrive. Children have an inborn preference for sweet taste, which would lead to a natural acceptance and consumption of breastmilk. From an evolutionary point of view, this makes an inborn acceptance of salt taste not needed per se.

By the age of approximately 4 to 6 months, when sodium channels have further matured, infants prefer salty water over plain water and salted baby cereal over plain baby cereal, as measured by ingestion. This shift from indifference to the preference for salted water is thought to reflect an unlearned biological response to salty taste rather than a learned response. However, this does not mean that the addition of salt to any baby food would ensure an increase in consumption. When salt was added to baby formula, 6- to 7-months-old infants found it less palatable, as measured by frequency of sucks, than baby formula without added salt. Presumably, because the addition of salt made the baby formula less sweet, which was confirmed by a trained adult sensory panel. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the addition of salt created an unknown flavor combination, which infants rejected because of its novelty.

In summary, infantsâ€™ ability to detect salt taste develops postnatally such that infants younger than about three months of age are most likely not able to see salt taste. Once infants can detect salt taste, they prefer salt to taste in water. There is no prior exposure to salt taste needed for infants to prefer salted water, which suggests an unlearned biological response to salt taste.''',
